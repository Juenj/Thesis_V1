# Thesis

This repository has a lot of clutter. The main functionality is contained within libs, and the prototype_UI notebook. To run the code you also need access to DBU tracking data, which we cannot uplpad to github. The DBU_env.yaml, contains all of the required python dependencies and can be used with the anaconda environment manager.
